"""SQLite-backed durable registry for the pi-manager plugin.

Three tables:

- ``tasks``  — one row per task, holding the mutable current state. Fields
  match the spec in ``tasks/2026-08-26-engineering-pi-rpc-monitoring``.
  The ``origin`` column holds the routing snapshot captured at dispatch
  time (serializable JSON, never a context object).
- ``events`` — append-only diagnostic trace. Never updated, only inserted.
- ``notifications`` — the plugin's durable delivery outbox. Rows move
  pending -> leased -> sent (or failed); a stale lease is requeued by the
  next claim, so a crash mid-send never loses a notification.

The database lives at ``$HERMES_HOME/state/pi-manager/registry.sqlite3`` by
default (overridable for tests). WAL mode is enabled so a concurrent reader
(e.g. ``pi_status`` from another process) never blocks a writer.

Payload summaries are bounded (``MAX_SUMMARY_CHARS``) — this module never
persists full message text or a token firehose, only short diagnostic
strings (event type, tool name, truncated head of any text field).
