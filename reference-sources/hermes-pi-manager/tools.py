"""pi-manager tool schemas and handlers.

Registers seven tools through the Hermes plugin public API
(``ctx.register_tool(name, toolset, schema, handler, is_async=...)``,
verified against ``~/.hermes/hermes-agent/hermes_cli/plugins.py`` and the
``plugins/spotify`` bundled example):

- ``pi_task``   — start one Pi RPC task; returns immediately (STARTING).
  Safe to call twice back to back for two parallel tasks (ceiling: 2).
- ``pi_status`` — read current task status from the registry.
- ``pi_abort``  — kill switch (RPC abort -> SIGTERM -> SIGKILL).
- ``pi_steer``  — send a Pi ``steer`` command to a live task.
- ``pi_resume`` — explicit re-run of the recovery algorithm for one task.
- ``pi_digest`` — what a delegate DID, in ~2 KB, instead of its transcript.

A ``pi_verify`` tool is also exposed: verification is a separate step from
execution per the spec ("execution_state vs verification_state are
distinct"), and the CLI/tool contract needs an explicit way to trigger it
once a task has reached SETTLED, since not every task carries an
auto-verifier at start time.

There is deliberately NO blocking wait tool. ``pi_wait`` existed until
2026-08-28 and was removed: waiting is strictly worse than the completion
notice on both axes that matter. The notice fires from ``_run_verifier``'s
``finally``, i.e. AFTER the gate resolves, so it carries the real PASS/FAIL —
a wait returns at ``agent_settled``, when ``verification_state`` is still
PENDING and the answer the caller actually wants does not exist yet. And a
wait freezes its whole conversation for the duration (the default was 15
minutes) to learn less. Callers end their turn. Two things come back to
them: the passive Telegram completion notice (outbox -> host adapter), and,
for tasks dispatched from a gateway/Telegram session, a single terminal
wake of the SAME session via ``TerminalWakeWorker``
(``wake_worker.py`` -> ``ctx.inject_message``) asking the orchestrator to
analyze the result and continue the parent workflow.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Notifications: the plugin's own durable outbox.
#
# The first attempt at completion notices injected them straight into the
# caller's session. That worked exactly once — for a single conversation
# with nothing else running — and then failed with "not routed" as soon as
# Hermes had two sessions open. The second attempt pushed them onto a
# private internal Hermes queue, disguised as a framework-internal
# delegation event. That rail is not a public plugin API: its shape is an
# internal contract that can change, its delivery is owned by whichever
# process drains it, and it carries a fiction (this plugin is not one of
# those framework-internal delegations). This stage replaces it with what
# the plugin already owns:
# a SQLite outbox row per notification, and a worker that delivers each one
# by calling the plugin-local host adapter (host_adapter.py) directly —
# the adapter imports and directly calls the Hermes-native
# tools.send_message_tool.send_message_tool. Core intentionally never
# registers send_message in the ToolRegistry (host-only invariant), so the
# plugin registers NO send_message entry at all; delivery reaches the
# native rail by importing and calling its implementation, not through
# the registry.
#
# The routing origin is captured on the dispatching turn (contextvars do not
# survive into the settle thread) and persisted WITH the task in the
# registry, so settlement, crash, restart and recovery all deliver to the
# conversation that asked for the work — with no in-memory dict standing
# between them.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Terminal continuation wake worker (separate from the Telegram outbox).
# This worker is the ONE place in the plugin that holds a PluginContext and
# the ONE path that calls ctx.inject_message: the user-approved terminal
# wake of the original orchestrator session. The fresh ctx of each
# registration is passed in here and kept only inside the worker — never in
# the PiManager core, never on a task. On reload the old worker is stopped
# BEFORE the new one starts (the opposite of the outbox order on purpose):
# a fresh worker must never mark a LIVE in-flight dispatch 'uncertain'.
