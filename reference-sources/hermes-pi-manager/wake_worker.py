"""One durable terminal continuation per Pi task, after verification.

CLI and gateway retain PluginContext.inject_message. CLI delivery is bound to
origin.host_runtime_id; gateway delivery requires a live gateway injector.
Desktop/TUI uses desktop_host only in the backend holding the matching session.
It waits behind the running turn and human FIFO; missing/busy owners spend no
retry budget. There is no Bot Chat redirect or fallback to an unrelated CLI.

An accepted wake is never replayed. Gateway acceptance only proves scheduling;
Desktop also records wake_turn_finished from the native terminal callback.
A dispatch whose process died, or whose Desktop admission raised after a possible
start, becomes uncertain: inspect evidence manually instead of duplicating a turn.
Live dispatchers are preserved across other workers' recovery passes.

Progress notices use the separate passive outbox and never start a model turn.
The worker owns only its current PluginContext, not a second session or queue.
